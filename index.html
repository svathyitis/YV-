  <h2>Day 1: 🌟 Prince Rama's Questions</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">Why do we feel sad sometimes?</p>

  <h3>Story</h3>
  <p class="subtitle">
    Once upon a time, Prince Rama was very sad and confused. Even though he had everything – a beautiful palace,
    loving family, and all the toys he could want – he still felt empty inside.<br><br>
    “Father,” said Rama, “why do I feel sad when I have everything? Why do some people seem happy with so little,
    while I feel unhappy with so much? What is the point of life if we all just grow old and die?”<br><br>
    King Dasharatha was worried. His wise son was asking very deep questions! So he called for the wisest teacher
    in the kingdom – Sage Vasishta.<br><br>
    “My dear child,” said Sage Vasishta with a kind smile, “these are wonderful questions! It shows you're growing
    wiser. Let me tell you some stories that will help you understand...”
  </p>

  <h3>✨ Lesson</h3>
  <p class="subtitle">It's okay to feel confused or sad. Asking deep questions shows we're growing wiser!</p>

  <p class="subtitle">What is real and what is pretend?</p>

  <h3>Story</h3>
  <p class="subtitle">
    “Let me tell you about a magical palace,” said Sage Vasishta.<br><br>
    “Once, there was a boy who found a beautiful palace that appeared out of nowhere. Inside, he saw amazing treasures,
    delicious food, and wonderful games. He spent days enjoying everything.<br><br>
    But then, an old wise woman appeared. ‘Child,’ she said, ‘this palace is made of dreams and imagination.
    The real palace is in your heart – filled with love, kindness, and peace. That palace can never disappear.’<br><br>
    The boy realized that the most beautiful things – like love from family, friendship, and inner peace – are
    more real and lasting than anything made of gold or jewels.”
  </p>

  <h3>✨ Lesson</h3>
  <p class="subtitle">The most important treasures are invisible – they live in our hearts and can never be taken away.</p>

  <h2>Day 3: 🌊 The Ocean of Life</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">Why life has ups and downs</p>

  <h3>Story</h3>
  <p class="subtitle">
    “Life is like a great ocean,” continued Sage Vasishta.<br><br>
    “Watch the waves, dear Rama. Sometimes they're big, sometimes small.
    Sometimes the ocean is calm, sometimes stormy. But deep down, the ocean itself never changes.<br><br>
    A wise sailor doesn't get upset with the waves. Instead, he learns to sail with them. When storms come, he stays calm and waits.
    When the wind is good, he enjoys the journey.<br><br>
    You are like that deep, peaceful ocean. Your feelings are like waves – they come and go.
    But the real you, deep inside, is always peaceful and strong.”
  </p>

  <h3>✨ Lesson</h3>
  <p class="subtitle">Our feelings come and go like waves, but our true self is like the deep, peaceful ocean – always calm and strong.</p>

  <h2>Day 4: 🎭 The Great Play of Life</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">We're all actors in life's story</p>

  <h3>Story</h3>
  <p class="subtitle">
    “Imagine life is like a great play,” said the sage.<br><br>
    “In this play, everyone has a role. Some play kings, some play servants, some play teachers, some play students.
    But here's the secret – we're all just actors!<br><br>
    A good actor plays their role well but doesn't forget who they really are. If they play a sad character,
    they don't become truly sad. If they play a happy character, they enjoy it but know it's just for the play.<br><br>
    When you remember that life is like a play, you can enjoy your role without taking everything too seriously.
    You can be the best ‘you’ possible while staying peaceful inside.”
  </p>

  <p class="subtitle">Understanding how time flows</p>

  <h3>Story</h3>
  <p class="subtitle">
    “Time is like a flowing river,” explained Sage Vasishta.<br><br>
    “You cannot stop a river or make it flow backwards. But you can enjoy each moment as the water flows by.
    You can put your hand in the water and feel its coolness. You can watch the beautiful reflections.<br><br>
    Some people spend all their time wishing they could go back to yesterday or worrying about tomorrow.
    But the only real moment is right now – this very second!<br><br>
    When you learn to enjoy this moment, every moment becomes special and beautiful.”
  </p>

  <h3>✨ Lesson</h3>

  <h3>Story</h3>
  <p class="subtitle">
    “Inside every person is a magic seed,” said the wise teacher.<br><br>
    “This seed is called wisdom. Just like a plant seed needs water and sunlight to grow, your wisdom seed needs
    good thoughts and kind actions to grow.<br><br>
    At first, the seed is tiny and you can't see it. But as you ask good questions, help others, and think about life,
    the seed starts to sprout. Slowly, it grows into a beautiful tree of understanding.<br><br>
    This tree gives shade to others and bears the sweet fruit of peace and happiness.”

  <h3>Story</h3>
  <p class="subtitle">
    “You are like an artist painting a picture,” said Sage Vasishta.<br><br>
    “Every day, you choose what colors to use. If you choose bright, happy colors like kindness and gratitude,
    your life becomes beautiful. If you choose dark colors like anger and sadness all the time,
    your picture becomes gloomy.<br><br>
    But here's the wonderful secret – you can always add new colors!
    Even if you made some dark strokes, you can paint beautiful flowers and sunshine over them.<br><br>
    You are the artist of your own life. What kind of masterpiece will you create?”

  <p class="subtitle">
    “Every great journey begins with a single step,” said Sage Vasishta.<br><br>
    “Once there was a young explorer who wanted to find the greatest treasure in the world.
    He searched everywhere – in caves, on mountains, under the sea. But he couldn't find it anywhere.<br><br>
    Finally, an old woman told him: ‘The greatest treasure is not hidden in any place.
    It's hidden in plain sight, closer than your own breath.’<br><br>
    The explorer realized the treasure was his own peaceful, loving heart – it had been with him all along!”

    Fourth, find the peace that’s always inside you.<br><br>
    It's like a garden with four sections – flowers of kindness, vegetables of hard work, fruits of joy, and a quiet pond of peace.
    A wise gardener takes care of all four sections!”
